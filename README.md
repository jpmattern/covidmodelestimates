# COVID-19 model projections for Santa Cruz County

The County of Santa Cruz COVID-19 model is a probabilistic SEIR model with compartments for hospitalizations and ICU visits. Population-averaged COVID-19 data from three wastewater plants, along with hospitalization, ICU and death data, are used to inform model estimates using Bayesian techniques. These estimates include the effective reproductive number Rt and hospitalization projections, available here and shown at the [County of Santa Cruz Health Services Agency website](https://santacruzhealth.org/HSAHome/HSADivisions/PublicHealth/CommunicableDiseaseControl/CoronavirusHome.aspx).
